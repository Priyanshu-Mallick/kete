Problem Statement:
►	Whenever we go to a fruit shop, a vegetable shop, a grocery shop or a mall, where things are put on a view; there at the time of rush hour we often ask the shopkeeper to tell us the price of the items we are going to buy. Only after that we decide whether to buy the product or not. Not only that, in malls and supermarkets, often we see huge lines near the cash counter, this often leads to wastage of time.
►	In other way around, during the same rush hours, the shopkeeper might get irritated and might ignore us or it might also turn into a heated conversation.
►	There might be a calculation error while paying the bill as well.
Solution:
Thus, to solve this problem, we Team GENISIS has come up with an Augmented Reality (AR) powered app which will display the price of the product we want to know through scanning the object (Real Time Object Detection). Addition to that there is a payment gateway which leads to payment of the products that will be added to wishlist. After that, an online bill will be generated which the shopkeeper or the mall authority can verify which will reduce long waiting hours at the billdesk and reduce the use of paper. 
Procedure:
1. QR Codes for Seller:
Retailers shall log in to the admin portal and generate his/her own QR code which will contain the pricelist of every registered and unregistered products. The QR generated shall be taken out as a print-out which will be show-cased in front of his/her shop.
2. Scan QR code:
For users, they need to log in to the user portal before using any applications of the app. Now a new window will open which will have the scanner - using it, the customer needs to scan the QR code of the respective retailer shop.
3. AR leads the path:
Now user can scan the items whose price the user wants to know. The app will pop up the price tag of the object in real-time in an animated way (AR) which will contain a check box. If the user checks the check box, then the item will be added to the wishlist along with its price.
4. Wish a Wishlist:
After scanning all the elements, you can go to the wishlist and can look up to the total bill that you need to pay. You can remove the elements according to your wish and then you can click on the Pay button once all the things are finalized.
5. Checkout and Pay:
The payment portal will open and the user now can choose the desired payment option to pay the bill.
